<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [EDIC](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/) fellowship program at **EPFL**, where I am fortunately advised by [Haitham Hassanieh](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh?lang=en) in the [SENS (Laboratory of Sensing and Networking Systems)](https://sens.epfl.ch/) group. My research sits at the intersection of **wireless sensing**, **autonomous driving**, and **3D vision**.

Prior to joining EPFL, I earned my Master’s degree from Fudan University and my Bachelor’s degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). During my time in Shanghai, my work spanned the full spectrum of computer vision, from **large multi-modality models**, **3D/2D generative models**, **3D perception** to the **Transformer theory**.
