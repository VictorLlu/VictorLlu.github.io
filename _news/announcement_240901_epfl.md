I am excited to share that I have joined **EPFL** as a Computer Science Ph.D. student! I will be part of the [EDIC](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/) fellowship program and a member of the [SENS Lab](https://sens.epfl.ch/). Looking forward to working on wireless sensing and 3D vision in Lausanne! :switzerland:
